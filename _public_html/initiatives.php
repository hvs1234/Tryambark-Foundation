              Tryambak Foundation is not just an NGO working to provide education, but we are committed to the overall growth of villages that are not on the top of the checklist of development. We also work in the conservation of the environment and culture so that the migration process can be minimized. All of us must have heard a proverb in Uttarakhand, 
            </p>
            <blockquote>" पहाड़ का पानी और पहाड़ की जवानी पहाड़ में नही रूकती "</blockquote> 
            <p class="text-justify mb-5">
              This proverb is the reflector of the worst situation of migration in Uttarakhand. Tryambak Foundation is committed to minimizing the migration process by providing adequate facilities, education, a skill development center, and an economic center so that villagers can get their basic needs fulfilled at their homes only. Tryamabak Foundation is currently working under three categories, these are:

                  <p class="text-justify">We work in the establishment of education and skill development centers in the remote villages of Uttarakhand. We adopted "Adarsh Model School" of Pauri Garwhal. This is a 50-plus strength school from 1st to 5th grade but due to negligence, the school was in the worst condition. Tryambak Foundation adopted the school and renovate the infrastructure and education pattern thus developing it as a model school in Uttarakhand's villages. Similarly, we are expanding our NGO to many remote villages by adopting more schools and establishing skill development centers in the villages. Our motto is to offer job-oriented courses in the village itself thus helping the reverse migration process.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify">The land of Uttarakhand is having a vivid topography including snow-covered mountain peaks, free-flowing streams, glaciers, beautiful lakes, deep canyons, and dusty plains too. Due to the unplanned cutting of trees and an increase in pollution levels, the ecological balance of the state is affected. We along with the founder of the Maiti movement, Padam Shree Kalyan Singh Rawat Ji, work to conserve the forests and wildlife of Uttarakhand. Our NGO encourages the plantation process by adding Maiti to the rituals of weddings in Uttarakhand. We actively participated in organizing various fairs and festivals related to the conservation of the environment and wildlife.</p>
